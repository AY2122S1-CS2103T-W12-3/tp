<h3><i>Welcome to the Pocket Hotel User Guide!</i></h3>

**Pocket Hotel (PH)** is a specialized contact management desktop app targeted towards hotel front office staff such as front desk staff who
frequently interact with guests.

**PH** provides a centralized location to store, organize and manage information linked to your guests and vendors employed by the hotel. **PH**
streamlines your workflow and is optimized for use via the _Command Line Interface_ (**CLI**), whilst still embodying
the benefits of a _Graphical User Interface_ (**GUI**).

This user guide serves as an entry point for users to get oriented with how **PH** operates and how you may utilize it
fully to integrate it within your hotel management system.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for **PH**.

4. To start the application, you may either:
    1. Double-click the `PH.jar` file to boot up the app.
    2. Open up your shell terminal in the directory where **PH** resides, and run the command `java -jar PH.jar`.

      named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

the commands.

## **Features**

**PH**â€™s features revolve around managing your guests and vendors. For each command, a short description of its use is
given which is then followed by the format and a short example to help ensure that you have executed the command
correctly.

A quick overview of all the commands can be found in the [command summary](#command-summary).

Certain commands require parameters, which may have constraints. A quick overview of all the underlying
// TODO Fix link
constraints can be found in the [parameter constraints.](#parameter-constraints-summary)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be entered by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameter prefixes such as `n/` and `pn/` are special keywords that indicate a start of a parameter.

* Fields with square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bing Cheng t/VIP` or as `n/Bing Cheng`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME pn/PASSPORT_NUMBER`, `pn/PASSPORT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* All fields cannot be empty
* The tag field is optional and can be omitted entirely
</div>

// TODO add note: commands can be executed regardless of current list being viewed, e.g clearguest can be executed though the current list viewed is the vendor

### Contacts in Pocket Hotel
There are 2 types of contacts in **PH**, guests and vendors. Guests represent guests of the hotel, and vendors represent external companies employed by a hotel for services hotel. Guest are identified by their `PASSPORT_NUMBER`
and Vendors are identified by their `VENDOR_ID`. These fields are their unique identifier, and no two contacts can have the same unique identifier.

It is possible for guests and vendors to have the same unique identifier for example, `VENDOR_ID` of a vendor is 111 and `PASSPORT_NUMBER` for a guest is 111, as they represent 2 different entities.

Guests and vendors have different parameters, which can be found in the [parameter constraints table](#parameter-constraints-summary) or in the command instructions.
