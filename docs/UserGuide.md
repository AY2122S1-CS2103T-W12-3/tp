<h3><i>Welcome to the Pocket Hotel User Guide!</i></h3>

**Pocket Hotel (PH)** is a specialized contact management desktop app targeted towards hotel front office staff such as front desk staff who
frequently interact with guests.

**PH** provides a centralized location to store, organize and manage information linked to your guests and vendors employed by the hotel. **PH**
streamlines your workflow and is optimized for use via the _Command Line Interface_ (**CLI**), whilst still embodying
the benefits of a _Graphical User Interface_ (**GUI**).

This user guide serves as an entry point for users to get oriented with how **PH** operates and how you may utilize it
fully to integrate it within your hotel management system.

## **Quick start**
1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer ([Instructions on how to check Java version](#faq)).

2. Download the latest `PH.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for **PH**.

4. To start the application, you may either:
  1. Double-click the `PH.jar` file to boot up the app.
  2. Open up your shell terminal in the directory where **PH** resides, and run the command `java -jar PH.jar`.
     The **GUI** similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

<p align="center"><i>Figure 1. Pocket Hotel GUI</i></p>
5. Type any command in the command box (Denoted by "Enter command here" text) and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will
   open the help window. Click the tab for the list that you would like to view e.g click vendor to view vendors in stored in **PH**<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`checkin`**`n/John Doe pn/X12345678F r/123 e/johnd@example.com t/Senior Citizen` : Adds a guest
      named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * **`deleteguest`**`pn/X12345678F` : Deletes the guest with passport number X12345678F.

    * **`clearguest`** : Deletes all guests from guest list.

    * **`addvendor`**

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

You may refer to the [features](#features) below for details of each command and to get familiarized with the syntax of
the commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **Features**

**PH**â€™s features revolve around managing your guests and vendors. For each command, a short description of its use is
given which is then followed by the format and a short example to help ensure that you have executed the command
correctly.

A quick overview of all the commands can be found in the [command summary](#command-summary).

Certain commands require parameters, which may have constraints. A quick overview of all the underlying
constraints can be found in the [parameter constraints.](#parameter-constraints-summary)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be entered by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameter prefixes such as `n/` and `pn/` are special keywords that indicate a start of a parameter.

* Fields with square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bing Cheng t/VIP` or as `n/Bing Cheng`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME pn/PASSPORT_NUMBER`, `pn/PASSPORT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* All fields cannot be empty
* The tag field is optional and can be omitted entirely

### Contacts in Pocket Hotel
There are 2 types of contacts in **PH**, guests and vendors. Guests represent guests of the hotel, and vendors represent external companies employed by a hotel for services hotel. Guest are identified by their `PASSPORT_NUMBER`
and Vendors are identified by their `VENDOR_ID`. These fields are their unique identifier, and no two contacts can have the same unique identifier.

It is possible for guests and vendors to have the same unique identifier for example, `VENDOR_ID` of a vendor is 111 and `PASSPORT_NUMBER` for a guest is 111, as they represent 2 different entities.

Guests and vendors have different parameters, which can be found in the [parameter constraints table](#parameter-constraints-summary) or in the command instructions.

### Navigating between guest and vendor list
To navigate between the guest and vendor list, click the button on the **GUI** to view the different lists

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Regardless of the list currently being viewed, you are able to execute any command. e.g While viewing the guest list,
  you are able to add a vendor. Toggle back to the vendor list to see the reflected changes.
</div>

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Filter guest list: `filterguest`

Displays only the guests that meet your requirements, as specified by what you wrote in your filter. This helps you 
easily find and search through smaller and more manageable lists, instead of scrolling through the entire guest list.

Format:
`filterguest <FILTER_FIELD_NAME>/<FILTER_FIELD_VALUE>`

Parameters:
* `PASSPORT_NUMBER`: Should only contain alphanumeric characters.
  * The passport number specified by you must match the guest passport's number exactly to be filtered. Passport numbers are case-sensitive.
  * E.g. a guest with a `PASSPORT_NUMBER` of `SE1239182` will not be shown in your **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest pn/SE123`
* `NAME`: Should only contain alphabetical characters
  * The name specified by you simply needs to match the guest's name partially to be filtered. Names are case-insensitive.
  * E.g. a guest with a `NAME` of `Jeremy Tan` will be shown in the **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest n/jeremy` or `filterguest n/remy`
    * However, running the command `filterguest n/tan jeremy` will not filter the guest.
* `EMAIL`: A valid email address should be used.
  * The email specified by you simply needs to match the guest's email partially to be filtered. Emails are case-insensitive.
  * E.g. a guest with a `EMAIL` of `jeremytan@example.com` will be shown in the **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest e/tan`
* `ROOM_NUMBER`: Only numbers greater than 0 are valid.
  * The room number specified by you needs to match with the guest's room number partially to be filtered, however the order is important, unlike `EMAIL` and `NAME`.
  * E.g. a guest with a `ROOM_NUMBER` of `201` will be shown in the **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest r/2`
    * However, the guest will not be filtered if you run the command `filterguest r/1`. The reason for this is that hotels 
    generally have room numbers with its starting number as the floor level. Such as all hotel rooms on level 1, will 
    have their room number starting with 1. 
    * We felt that this would provide you a more useful filter, as running `filterguest r/2` would filter all the guest 
    with their room number starting with a 2, and in essence you would be filtering all the guests that are residing in 
    the second floor of your hotel. This would mean guests with `ROOM_NUMBER` that do not start with `2` but may have `2` 
    in their `ROOM_NUMBER` are not filtered. An example being `102`.
* `TAG`: An optional field, more than one can be included in the command. Tags are case-insensitive.
  * The tags specified by you need to match the guest's tags exactly to be filtered. 
  * E.g. guests with a `TAG` of `VIP` and guests with a `TAG` of `Deluxe` will be filtered if you run the command `filterguest t/vip t/deluxe`
    * Note that guest with either one of the tags gets filtered, they do not have to both tags to get filtered. The same logic applies when more than two tags are supplied by you.

Example:<br>
`filterguest n/boon r/2`, guests with a `NAME` that contains boon and have a `ROOM_NUMBER` starting with 2, will be filtered from **PH**.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Running the `filterguest` command always applies the filter to all your guests in **PH** and not to an already filtered guest list. 
</div>
